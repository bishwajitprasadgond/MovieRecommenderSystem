# MovieRecommenderSystem
In this Recommender system we have used TMDB dataset, Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to achieve our goals.
We have done all the coding part in movie_recommender_System.ipynb file and we have displayed it as web application using Sreamlit. The streamlit code part is there in app.py.
We have not uploaded "similarity.pkl" file of Model folder here because of its size exceed 100 MB max limit by Gihub .pkl file is a file created by pickle, a Python module that enabless objects to be serialized to files on disk and deserialized back into the program at runtime. It contains a byte stream that represents the objects.
You can download the "similarity.pkl" file of Model folder from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qJ6vusgOv68jsMuCYt79yfYTTAWfBEJ8/view?usp=sharing
We could optimize this model a little bit by assigning weightage to the user-defined priorities on the genre, cast, director and other concerned parameters.
