# MovieRecommenderSystem
In this Recommender system we have used TMDB dataset, Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to achieve our goals.
We have done all the coding part in movie_recommender_System.ipynb file and we have  displayed it as web application using Sreamlit. The streamlit code part is there in app.py.
We have not uploaded the virtual environment and lib here because of its size
